## What is EmpathAI?

A delightful AI therapist, based on a study on emotional intelligence in deep learning by PhD students at the University of Athens.
This study on data curation enabled me to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to emotions.

## How does it work?

It is a fine-tuned generative pre-trained transformer on a curated dataset that would, hypothetically,
allow the attention-heads to learn to focus on the emotion of the sentence, and generate a response that is
emotionally intelligent and humane, as-well as coherent and concise.

## Main challenges

This model does not have nearly as many parameters as the popular OpenAI's GPT,
and due to the extremely large size of these models they were able to achieve a chatbot
that can respond to emotions properly without utilizing a dataset specialzed for doing so.
