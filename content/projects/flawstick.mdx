## What is this?

A portfolio website for me, Amir Isaac (flawstick), as well as a blog.

## Motivation

Utter neglegance incandescent in us. Ignorant. Unbecoming. Irrepresentable.
Perhaps the purpose of the aforementioned portfolio is to connect with the last man's
network, a showcase, a desperate plea to the astounding world you make small, and blink.
- Thus Spake Zarathustra, the concept of the last man.
