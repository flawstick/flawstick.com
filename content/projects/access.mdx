A portfolio website for flawstick, A.K.A. Amir Isaac for the showcase of software developement projects.

## Motivation

Utter neglegance incandescent in us. Ignorant. Unbecoming. Irrepresentable. 
Perhaps the purpose of the aforementioned portfolio is to connect with the last man's
network, a showcase, a desperate plea to the astounding world you make small, and blink. 
- Thus Spake Zarathustra, the concept of the last man.
