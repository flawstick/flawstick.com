## Virtual Assistant

Nara is a LLM (Large Language Model) capable of generating text, as-well as using attention heads in order to interpret the required actions based on user input. It is designed to be a friendly, humane, assistant with access to features in your windows computer.

## Humane Transformer

In Sanskrit, an ancient language of India, Nara means human.

This particular model was trained on data curated from casual speech using STT (Speech to Text) in order to create a more humane, friendly, and casual assistant.
This means that along with this model, I had to fine-tune a custom STT model to reduce noise and descrepencies in the data.
